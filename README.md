# Guess the Number Game ðŸŽ²

Welcome to the **Guess the Number** game! This is a simple Python game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.

## How It Works

1. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
2. You enter your guess.
3. The program provides feedback:
   - **"Too low!"** if your guess is less than the number.
   - **"Too high!"** if your guess is greater than the number.
   - **"Congratulations!"** when you guess the correct number.
4. The game also keeps track of the number of attempts you make before guessing correctly.
